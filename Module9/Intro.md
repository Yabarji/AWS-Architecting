## Why should you automate?
* Time Savings = Cost Savings 
* Standardized Resource Management

* No version control
* Lack of audit trails
* Inconsistent data management

    * Benefits of IaC
        * Repeatability

                * You'd be able to create a load balancer, an auto scaling group, a VPC, a security group, etc. 
        * Reusability
